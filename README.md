<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of testcontainerit is to explore how [containerit](https://o2r.info/containerit/articles/containerit.html) can be used to auto-generate Dockerfiles to support research compendia like those produced by [rrtools](https://github.com/benmarwick/rrtools/)

The workflow is in [/devstuff.R]
